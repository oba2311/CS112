```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(Matching)
data(lalonde)
library(randomForest)
```


```{r}
#Linear model for all lalonde:
LinearLalonde<-lm(re78~age+nodegr+black+hisp+treat+married+re75,data=lalonde)
#Subsetting:
HighSchool<-lalonde[lalonde$nodegr==0,]
NoHighSchool<-lalonde[lalonde$nodegr==1,]
#Linear Model of highschoolers:
LinearHighSchool=lm(re78~age+nodegr+black+hisp+treat+married+re75,data=HighSchool)
summary(LinearHighSchool)
#Linear Model of non highschoolers:
LinearNoHighSchool<-lm(re78~age+nodegr+black+hisp+treat+married+re75,data=NoHighSchool)
summary(LinearNoHighSchool)
```

Construct confidence intervals
```{r}
confint(LinearHighSchool, 'treat', level=0.95)
confint(LinearNoHighSchool, 'treat', level=0.95)
```

Method 2 - Random Forest:
Prepare data for causal inference: Highschool treated:
```{r}
#Get the control units out:
AllTreated<-lalonde[lalonde$treat==1,]
#Control
AllControl<-lalonde[lalonde$treat==0,]
#Create a general model for lalonde to predict re78 based on all data:
RFGeneral<-randomForest(re78~age+nodegr+treat+black+hisp+married+re75,data=lalonde,replace = TRUE)
RFGeneral

#Highschool with treatment:
HighSchoolTreated<-AllTreated[AllTreated$nodegr==0,]
```

Highschool CF:
Assign no treatment to the same units (unobesrved potential outcome):
```{r}
#assigns control values to the units under treatment:
HighSchoolTreated$treat[HighSchoolTreated$treat == 1] <- 0
HighSchoolCF<-HighSchoolTreated
#Predict re78  CF for treated units:
CFre78Highschool<-predict(RFGeneral,HighSchoolCF)
```

#######################################################
No HighSchool, treated:
```{r}
NoHighSchoolTreated<-AllTreated[AllTreated$nodegr==1,]
#0 %in% NoHighSchoolTreated$nodegr     #Check that the data is indeed what we look for.
#0 %in% NoHighSchoolTreated$treat
```
No HighSchool, without treatment:
```{r}
#Assign counterfactual no treatment for treated units:
NoHighSchoolTreated$treat[NoHighSchoolTreated$treat==1] <- 0
NoHighSchoolCF<-NoHighSchoolTreated
#1 %in% NoHighSchoolCF$nodegr
#0 %in% NoHighSchoolCF$treat

CFre78NoHighschool<-predict(RFGeneral,NoHighSchoolCF)
```

Compare to observed data and CFs, to obtain treatment effect:
```{r}
#Highschool:
ReasultsTreatmenHighschool<-mean(HighSchoolTreated$re78) #<- this is the mean for the treated folks in highschool.

#Difference of means for highschoolers:
TreatEffectHS<-(ReasultsTreatmenHighschool - mean(CFre78Highschool))
TreatEffectHS

#NoHighschool:
#Treated no highschool:
ReasultsTreatmentNoHighschool<-mean(NoHighSchoolTreated$re78)

#Difference of means for Non highschoolers:
TreatEffectNoHS<-(ReasultsTreatmentNoHighschool-mean(CFre78NoHighschool))
TreatEffectNoHS
#Difference of treatment effect between highschoolers and nonhighschoolers:
TreatEffectHS-TreatEffectNoHS
```
We see that a highschool degree boosts the treatment effect by quite a big amount.

#Fisher Exact Test:
#Data preparation:
```{r}
#split Lalonde, based on random assignment mechanism: 

Vec=c()
i <- 1
for (i in 1:1000){
  treatment<-sample(nrow(lalonde), nrow(lalonde)/2, replace = TRUE, prob = NULL)
  control<-lalonde[-treatment,]
  treatment<-lalonde[treatment,]
  DiffMeans<-mean(treatment$re78)-mean(control$re78)
  while(i<1000) {
    Vec[i] <- DiffMeans
      i <- i + 1
  }
}
```

#Plot:
```{r}
# Exploring the results
plot(density(Vec))
abline(v=TreatEffectHS-TreatEffectNoHS, col="red")
abline(v=quantile(Vec,c(0.025,0.975)),col="blue")
```
